# GAME OVERVIEW
This is a simple falling ball catching game. The game draws the player paddle, the ball, and the text on screen and the ball falls. The game checks where the ball is to see if the ball has been caught or has fallen past the canvas, then resets the ball. There is also a lives system (called “will to live”) that tracks how many times the player has dropped the ball. The game stops when this hits 0.

## The Different Versions
There are three versions of this code:
1. NORMAL: this is the code I expect most of you to start with.
2. CHALLENGE: the same code as above, but without any line breaks. More challenging to parse!
3. COMMENTED: if you are really stuck, this is the code with my comments added to explain what each bit is doing.
